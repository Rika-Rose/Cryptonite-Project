# Cryptonite-Project

Hi, <br>
this is my Crypto-Currency project for my John-Bryce Fullstack web develpoment course.<br>
In this project, we were required to display crypto currencies from an api,<br>
allowing for additional information to be displayed when requested, and giving the option to mark up to 5 coins.<br>
As a bonus excercise, I also gave the user the option to display live currency report to compare his chosen coins in.<br>
In the 'About' section of the project, you can find out a bit more about me.<br>
Thank you for looking through.<br>
