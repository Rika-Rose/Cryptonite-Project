# Cryptonite-Project

Hi,
this is my Crypto-Currency project for my John-Bryce Fullstack web develpoment course.
In this project, we were required to display crypto currencies from an api,
allowing for additional information to be displayed when requested, and giving the option to mark up to 5 coins.
As a bonus excercise, I also gave the user the option to display live currency report to compare his chosen coins in.
In the 'About' section of the project, you can find out a bit more about me.
Thank you for looking through.
